This is a Scala implementation of some stemming exercises designed to highlight how the Porter algorithm works. The credit goes to [aztek](https://github.com/aztek/) who wrote the initial code, that I refactored and based my examples off.

Usage:
======

Running this project is quite simple. Make sure you have SBT installed (Scala Build Tool) and simple navigate to the directory and run SBT:
```shell
cd porterstemmer

sbt
```

Once SBT has loaded, you can use the Scalatra commands to run the webserver:
```shell
container:start
```

And then browse to http://localhost:8080/
